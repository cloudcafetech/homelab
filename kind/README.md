## Multi Cluster Management [MCO](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/ocm) 

Welcome! The open-cluster-management.io project is focused on enabling end-to-end visibility and control across your Kubernetes clusters.

The Open Cluster Management (OCM) architecture uses a hub - agent model. The hub centralizes control of all the managed clusters. An agent, which we call the klusterlet, resides on each managed cluster to manage registration to the hub and run instructions from the hub.
